        <h1>Welcome To Our Site!</h1>
    <p> I dont buy a daily paper anymore, as I tend to look at news online, but the structure of articles on news
        web sites is very similar to the structure of articles in newspapers. Each article is made up of headings,
        paragraphs of text, and some pictures (sometimes the pictures might be replaced by a video). The
        parallel is quite clear; the only real difference is that in a newspaper you may have several stories on a
        single page, whereas on the Web each story tends to get its own page. The news web sites also often use
        homepages that display the headline and a brief summary of the stories.
